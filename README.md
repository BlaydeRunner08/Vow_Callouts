# callouts
Vow of the Disciple callout helper for console

Runs on Raspberry Pi devices that support OTG-USB on /dev/hidg0.  

Connect Raspberry Pi's USB-OTG port to console USB port to act as a USB keyboard.

Run callouts server on Raspberry Pi, connect to server from any browser 
(PC/mobile/tablet) to get web UI to select icons to transmit callouts over text chat without having to type them in.

Developed and tested using a Raspberry Pi Zero WH and Xbox Series X using this USB dongle for the RPI (power and USB connection to Xbox):

I'm unlikely to maintain this until such a time as Raspberry Pi devices become more widely available.  For now I'm focusing on the solution using Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE.  See:
